    <h2>About Legacy Land Company</h2>
    <p>
        Legacy Land Company was born out of friendship, family ties, and a deep-rooted connection to the land.
        We’re a group of lifelong friends who grew up exploring wide-open spaces and watching our families
        manage and pass down rural properties through generations. Over the years, we saw land come and go - some sold,
        some inherited, some hard-won. Those experiences stuck with us.
    </p>
    <p>
        What started as conversations around campfires and kitchen tables slowly turned into a vision:
        to help others find that same sense of freedom, legacy, and opportunity in owning land. Whether it’s
        a place to build a home, start a business, or just escape the noise, we believe everyone deserves their own piece of earth.
    </p>
    <p>
        This company isn’t just business - it’s personal. And we’re here to help you find your own legacy.
